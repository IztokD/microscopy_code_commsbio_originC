OriginC code was written for matching the fluorescence intensities of cells of B. subtilis wt PS-216 (comQ-yfp, srfA-cfp) imaged by fluorescence microscopy on channels for yfp and cfp. The analysed data is for publication in Nature communication biology paper by Dogsa et al.: Peptide signaling without feedback in signal production operates as a true quorum sensing communication system

The cell fluorescence intensities were extracted by ImageJ script given in Sretenovic et al, with the enabled option for the “Center of mass” (in “Set measurements” menu), which means that for each cell the corresponding x,y coordinates (xm, ym) are given. The data output of ImageJ (yfp, cfp channel data) is than pasted into the worksheets of OriginPro where the code bellow is run. The output are spatially matched fluorescence intensities of the same cell. These data were then used for co-localization analysis.
